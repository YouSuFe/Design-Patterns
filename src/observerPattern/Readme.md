# The Observer Pattern
## Definition
The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

It defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
