# The Facade Pattern
## Definition
The Facade Pattern is a software design pattern commonly used with object-oriented programming. The name is by analogy to an architectural facade.
The Facade Pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
