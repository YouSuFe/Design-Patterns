# Design Patterns
## Abstract Factory Pattern
### Definition
The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Adapter Pattern
### Definition
The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

## Command Pattern
### Definition
The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

## Composite Pattern
### Definition
The Composite Pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

## Decorator Pattern
### Definition
The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

## Facade Pattern
### Definition
The Facade Pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

## Factory Method Pattern
### Definition
The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

## Iterator Pattern
### Definition
The Iterator Pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

## Observer Pattern
### Definition
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

## Singleton Pattern
### Definition
The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.

## State Pattern
### Definition
The State Pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

## Strategy Pattern
### Definition
The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Template Method Pattern
### Definition
The Template Method Pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
